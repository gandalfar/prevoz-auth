Basic example demonstrating how to use OAuth2 based flow to authenticate user into Prevoz.org and create and delete a new ride.

It's using oauth2client from Google, that you can download from: 
https://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/downloads/list

Endpoints:

- https://prevoz.org/api/oauth2/authorize
- https://prevoz.org/api/oauth2/token
- https://prevoz.org/api/oauth2/revoke

Scope value is ignored/can be empty. Currently you get access to everything (create/update/remove).

Flow for mobile devices:

- Generate authorize url and show user Web browser that user visits and grants permission to your app
- Browser will be redirected to https://prevoz.org/simple/login/success/?code=123
- Catch/detect this redirect and code and close browser window. You can also have custom endpoint, it just has to be https due to protocol requirements.
- Finish token flow and save access token for later use. Right now tokens don't expire.
